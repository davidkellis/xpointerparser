This project is a subproject of my xbrlparser project.

I needed to be able to parse XPointer strings. See 
http://www.xbrl.org/Specification/XBRL-RECOMMENDATION-2003-12-31+Corrected-Errata-2008-07-02.htm#_3.5.4
for an explanation.

This project implements the XPointer productions as defined at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/
http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/

Some of the productions were taken from:
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/

The parser is generated from a Treetop (http://treetop.rubyforge.org/) grammar.
